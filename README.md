# Quarian Prisoner (& other cool stuff...)
Hi everyone! I'm Flapsnu, I wanna draw porn one day. Right now all I can do is code some naughty stuff, I hope you'll like it!

You can contact me anytime at flapsnu@gmail.com or check my [Hentai Foundry page](https://www.hentai-foundry.com/user/Flapsnu/profile), there's more space to talk about myself.

It's an editor with buttons and stuff to navigate through all the versions.
It was initally one set of images, but now there's more than one page, and even more are planned !

See the page [HERE](https://flapsnu.github.io/Quarian/page.html)! (Quarian Prisoner, Talia from Mass Effect)

D.Va pages [here](https://flapsnu.github.io/Quarian/dva.html) and [here](https://flapsnu.github.io/Quarian/dva_2.html).

## News
 - Lots of image compression! stuff (from mostly every page) should be waaay faster to load.

 
 - D.Va page #2 is up and running!
 - Added the preg chance to Quarian, along with a "loop preg once" option.
  - Second bonus page up! (Quarian Love Slave)
  - Currently working on a "story mode" (preset order of combinations)  ( ✧ ω ✧ ) (EDIT: doesn't look very good, I won't release it if I don't find a way to make it better. Right now it just removes all interactivity.)
  - For anyone who actually reads the news, you can press f12 to show the console and see exactly by how much you failed or passed the preg test :)

## Based on
Based on the [series of images](http://www.hentai-foundry.com/pictures/user/Throat/458185/Quarian-Prisoner) "Quarian prisoner" by the awesome [Throat](http://www.hentai-foundry.com/user/Throat/profile) !

## About
This was interesting to do because the set is huge, and **non-linear**. There are a lot of combinations and there is no particular order, it's better to use buttons to add or remove one thing at a time.

### Upcoming features (possibly)
- I initially wanted to hide the "preg chance" field at first, with a button "use pregnancy chance" or something. I first made it work, then I wasn't sure it needed to be hidden first.
- I also want to add a "use as un-pregnancy chance", so that once the "subject" is pregnant, there is a chance that the pregnancy disappears. It makes a little less sense but then you could press one button and you won't have to untick "pregnant" to add variety.
- Previous/next buttons (travel through all images by this order: tag/suit/preg/cum. So the first is "virgin" last is condom/preg/full tag and cum; or by another order chosen by user)
- bind +/- keys for cum, left/right for next/previous (or other actions).
- option to make cum and/or preg reset at suit change
- I think if I keep doing that with other image series, I'll do a main page that will redirect to all the pages (I can't add link to everything on every page, and going back to the github page can be a moodkiller).

A lot of the "upcoming features" have been implemented yet (like preg loop and +/- buttons) so the list looks kind of empty now. I'd be happy to add more stuff. I there are things you want to see hit me up !
